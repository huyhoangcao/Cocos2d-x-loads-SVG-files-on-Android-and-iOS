Cocos2d-x loads SVG files on Android and iOS

The code used is from the following libraries:

    CocosSVGSprite by namkazt: https://github.com/namkazt/CocosSVGSprite
    nanosvg by memononen: https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg

The code has been slightly modified from namkazt's CocosSVGSprite library to be able to load SVG files on Android and iOS.
